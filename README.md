<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
BuzzMate is a combination of a physical shapechanging phone cover and a android application that allows a visually impaired user to track the movement of a public transportation vehicle in relation to the user.  <br />
In doing so it allows the user to be more conscious of a given trip without having access to the visual modality. By making sure the user is aware when to get off at the correct stopping point and when to board. <br>
The logic of the system is comprised of a firestore database that holds the updating GPS location of various public transport vehicles and the user. The application then continously polls this database to give feedback of the updating locations and provides this feedback through a phone cover that has shapechanging features. <br/>
These features are non-invasive and provides varying amounts of feedback depending on the urgency of the time frame. So that the invasiveness of the physical shapechange increases as the time frame shrinks.
